# Comparative-analysis-of-European-Flights-Pre-During-and-Post-Covid-19
In this data visualization project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the profound impact COVID-19 had on air flight operations across the 42 countries within the European Union (EU) continent. The study spanned three distinct periods: pre-COVID, during the pandemic, and the post-COVID era. The comprehensive analysis examined key metrics, including "Departure flights," "Arrival flights," and the combined "Total flights," providing a holistic view of the aviation industry's challenges and recovery. Leveraging a robust dataset encompassing EU flight details from January 1, 2016, to May 31, 2022, this project delivered valuable insights into the resilience and adaptability of the aviation sector in the face of unprecedented disruptions. Through meticulous data visualization techniques, I presented compelling visuals that illuminated the intricate patterns and trends, and provided conclusions enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and strategize for future contingencies effectively.
